<p>Welcome to steam&#39;s next fest. Or should I say the next &quot;next fest&quot;? Anyways here we go, this time with 100% improved formatting, double the farming simulators, a ton more puns, witty remarks and most importantly a lot of love for games, demos and you! (Yes that&#39;s you :SoyPoint: )
As always I gave each game a fair 2-3 seconds to win over my interest with their trailer, so the dev&#39;s work has been given the greatest of respect~~ Anyways this time I have selected a whooping 33 demos for testing, so let&#39;s get straight into it.</p>
<p>As usual tl;dr at the bottom and in addition here is your subway surfers link to watch on the side for your tiktok rotten brains: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ghSziUQnhs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ghSziUQnhs</a></p>
<h2 id="demos">Demos</h2>
<p>The first Game on my list is <strong>Blacksmith Master</strong>. You guessed it, it&#39;s a metalsmith game. Nothing special. You take jobs from a map to make X things. Each step to make an X is a little mini game, think dbd reactor style. I got to the point where you can hire people to do stuff for you, but the damn menu is broken. Like come on man, playtest your fucking demo at least more than 2 minutes. Great start to this, maybe that&#39;s why they called it &quot;next fest&quot;. Next game!</p>
<p>Onwards to <strong>Daomei Village</strong> and let me tell you what the fuck is this. They literally took stardew valley and then thought to themselves lets make it the worst thing in existence. Lets take a look at the movement for a second. Pressing a direction doesn&#39;t walk you in that direction, no it accelerates you a bit until you actually move. So if you press left just a bit nothing happens. What is this. Simply walking to the right pixel to target the tile in front of you to use your tool on it is torture. Oh and btw, every time you move the entire screen flickers a bit. The tutorial tells you exactly what you need to do, all the way up towards planting something and watering it in an exact fucking tile. Get this shit away from me asap.</p>
<p>Big one next: <strong>Zephon</strong>. Big as in a big download. 3,6gb for a demo, this better be good... The game doesn&#39;t start, infinite loading screen. No, wait I got baited by the classic 5 minute startup loading screen. This is a civ/endless legend/dune/stellaris type game. Not really my cup of tea tbh. So, moving on quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Die in the dungeon</strong>. Die as in dice however. Cute graphics. The tutorial has a button actually called &quot;shut up&quot;. And didn&#39;t I play this demo before? Roguelike, you roll dice and put them on a board for attacks/defense/healing. There are special dice with special abilities. Basically a deckbuilder but with dice! Pretty cool game. No wonder this was already on my wishlist, recommended! (Had to make myself stop playing, there are other demos to get through after all)</p>
<p>Onwards to <strong>Wizard of legends 2</strong>. Never played the first but wanted to try this one because I heard a lot of good things about it. Lets call this game a hades like. It seems decent but I have a complaint. You are attacking from ranged but can only turn by moving. This way you always end up walking into enemies. In addition your basic ability is also moving you forwards? Idk maybe it&#39;s just me but it seems annoying to pilot. Doesn&#39;t seem like a bad game overall though, but play hades.</p>
<p><strong>Aloft</strong>. Generate a character (impossible to make one that isn&#39;t ugly), generate a world and off we go into this game?? A crafting survival game, the usual stuff, gather wood, stones, craft shit. 40fps. And what&#39;s this? A steep roof only costs 1 wood? Time to build a tower into the air and take a look over the map. Aaah right it&#39;s floating islands in the sky or some shit. The only thing floating here is this game: Floating into the garbage bin.</p>
<p>You saw this one before in streams: <strong>Enotria: The Last Song</strong>. A soulslike alright. But like all soulslikes it&#39;s a bit off. Animations feel a bit weird. You are animation lock you a bit too long in place for it to feel good, your blows feel a bit to weak. Seems like a game, but sorry devs, it ain&#39;t it for me.</p>
<p><strong>Kill Knight</strong>. Holy shit this fucking slaps. You are a knight, with guns, and a giga gun. You are fighting demons in an arena. Press all the buttons all the time and kill them all! A literal workout on your controler. Rip and tear until it is done. Wishlisted, will play more of this later it&#39;s a lot of fun.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s take a break from that insane action with <strong>Dungeons &amp; Degenerate Gamblers</strong>. Which is... Balatro but BlackJack. That&#39;s it. Pretty good however, it&#39;s fun. Creating decks and stuff like in Balatro. It really is simply Balatro. Wishlisted.</p>
<p><strong>Super Fantasy Kingdom</strong>. A shy little game that opens in a small window and can&#39;t be maximized with the topbar maximize button, but instead it has to be done through the settings. Well, let&#39;s play it- And now I understood why it was small. It&#39;s a tiny game where you built a city and recruit heroes to defend it. Like seriously, everything is super tiny. Very slow and automatic, kind of an afk game I suppose. Not too bad not to exciting either however.</p>
<p>Walking the <strong>Fields of Mistria</strong> next. Greeted by cute pixel graphics. Cute Characters. Everything is cute. Appears to be a well made stardew valley clone. NOT at all like the one I tried earlier. Okay game but why wouldn&#39;t I replay stardew once more?</p>
<p>More dice, this time with <strong>Dice &amp; Fold</strong>. So in this you roll dice to defeat (fold) your enemies. Real dice. Enemies have combinations you need to roll. You can find items and the usual stuff to improve your run. Seems fine but not enough craziness for my taste. In the end you are rolling normal dice. Maybe I&#39;m just bad it tho, possible.</p>
<p><strong>Glyphica: Typing Survival</strong>. A vampire like but you have to type the enemies names for them to be attacked. You can get upgrades that auto shoot but they are not enough to survive. Exhausting to play after a while, a lot of typing, even more than this review. Wink wink.</p>
<p><strong>Artisan TD</strong> a tower defense. That&#39;s it. Nothing other tower defense games didn&#39;t already do before. Still an okay game at the end of the day, but nothing new under the through climate change always hotter burning sun that will kill us all. Ok.</p>
<p>Hehe. <strong>Dustborn</strong> Why did I install this shit again? I suppose I wanted to give it a real shot but man. I hate absolutely every single thing about this as expected. Play it yourself and see what I mean. Complete garbage! Trash.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s look at a real game next. <strong>Sephiria</strong> A hades like. You are a bunny from bunnyville and have to defeat the big bad demon by traveling back in time every time you die. Cute. My god is it hard though. The moles that have been turned by the fanatics need to die!! Oh the artifact system is interesting, you find stuff that give you new attacks and passive buffs and you put them in a grid affecting each other and why am I still playing this? It&#39;s good. The moles must die.</p>
<p><strong>The Crush House</strong> Ah right the thirst shooter game. Uhm. What is this shit even. Get out of here. No further comments your honor.</p>
<p><strong>Mini Airways</strong> So after Mini Metro and Mini Motorways we get Mini Airways. The typical simple management game that is like an action puzzle. These games are always fun and relaxing to play. Not a bad one even though the planes always spam the same three voice lines.</p>
<p>Fall of Odin. <strong>Odinfall</strong> A nuclear throne like game. Why does the main character have no arms? Idk this one isn&#39;t doing it for me, there is way too much clutter and stuff going on at the same time. Gameplay didn&#39;t feel fun.</p>
<p><strong>Pinball Spire</strong> This is literally pinball in a dungeon with two problems. Problem One: The tutorial uses American keyboard layout, so you have to guess what button to press? Second problem: This game fucking sucks.</p>
<p><strong>Megacoptor: Blades of the Goddess</strong> Now that&#39;s a mouthful. You fly a helicopter and shoot stuff. Sorry devs but this game is awful. The controls are all floaty (Ha get it because you are flying?!) It&#39;s not fun to play. The only place this flies towards is into the same garbage bin aloft already flew. Don&#39;t waste your efforts on shit like this.</p>
<p><strong>Idle Colony</strong>. Omg I&#39;m gonna idle so hard. You harvest fruits (in a very idly way) and all of them get thrown into a giant wok where they slide to the center and combine into a bigger fruit if two of the same exist. It is fun to look at. Other than that, your typical idle game, a game where you don&#39;t play. Big brain stuff honestly.</p>
<p><strong>The spell brigade</strong> A vampire survivors like. These games live and die by their spell variety and how fun it is to level up. All I did in this game take cooldown reduction because it was the only fun option. And a spell that creates random dmg circles. However, these circles also damage myself. So all I did in this game dodge my own 0cd circles. Neat.</p>
<p>Lets get farming in <strong>Mini Settlers</strong>. Or rather let&#39;s get city building. It is one of those, in minimal style however. Seems okay. But again as in every demo fest, I am bored of city builders. Yawn.</p>
<p>Backpack Battles? No this is <strong>Backpack Monsters</strong>. Clearly different. Duh. But wait a second! It is literally the same game as backpack battles with a shittier style, less clarity and everything in your backpack is called a monster. Fuck off honestly with this awful copy.</p>
<p><strong>Technotopia</strong>. What a name. I expect city building. Well it is but no. It is one of those city puzzlers like Dorfromantik. Not my kind of thing but if you like to puzzle together four different aspects of a city, this might be ok? It even has random events and new stuff keeps getting added to your tiles you have to place. So yeah...</p>
<p>Now for one of my well liked series. <strong>Creeper World IXE</strong>. Creeper games are always dumb fun. There is creep you build towers to shoot it away. This time it is creeper in a powder simulator. Kinda meh tbh, it&#39;s more fun if it is top down and not as powdery. Sorry creeper world but this one&#39;s a miss.</p>
<p><strong>Codename: Ocean Keeper</strong>. AAAhh it&#39;s under water. You pilot a mech to caves, dig, shoot monsters. This is very boring. It&#39;s like that one game I already forgot the name off. (It was domekeeper I looked it up) Well it&#39;s not like I will remember this longer than this sentence trails on but my skills of writing nonsense are quite good so this game can life on a few more seconds but then suddenly, it&#39;s dead.</p>
<p>Not another farming game you say? <strong>Node Farm</strong> is exactly that. Farming. But the game opens in a 400x600 window. Sorry devs I almost overlooked your game by accident. This is another idle game intersected with forager mechanics like buying new islands. Hmm. No. Unremarkable. Boring. Next.</p>
<p><strong>Hell Survivors</strong>. Holy shit this menu music is a banger. And the game is a vampire survivor like. I swear I tried selecting almost none of them this time. They keep slipping in. Well anyways this one is meh. Banger music though. Now combine it with a good game!</p>
<p><strong>Bella wants Blood</strong> and I want Bella. No seriously what is this game? A stroke of genius. A diamond in this pile of trash. This is a tower defense but spliced with slay the spire. You move through the map nodes and each time you get a new tile, tower or passive buff. Demo is only one boss so pretty short but I had a lot of fun. It&#39;s honestly so well done, go try it out. And don&#39;t forget: Stanley~</p>
<p>It&#39;s nearly midnight so perfect time for the <strong>Thought experiment simulator</strong>. So this game is the classic thought experiments. Like Trolley Problem, Infinite Monkey, Veil of Ignorance, etc. But the main question remains for me: Why? Why am I playing this? Is this even a game? Why am I doing all of this in the first place? Why am I not spending my time and my writing on something better? Is anyone even reading this shit? Maybe the real thought experiment is the next fest in itself.</p>
<p>The last game is <strong>Drill Core</strong>. And it&#39;s another domekeeper like. Get me away from these pleaaase. But this time it is kind of fun. Reason being you have multiple units that can mine beneath your base. So it&#39;s a bit more of a management sim game instead of digging yourself. Well not too bad but still a bit boring for me at the end of the day.</p>
<h2 id="tl-dr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>Games to look at out of this bunch: Die in the dungeon, Kill Knight, Dungeons &amp; Degenerate Gamblers and most of all Bella wants Blood. Taking a look at these would probably be worth your time.</p>
<p>Cheers your local demo reviewer.</p>
